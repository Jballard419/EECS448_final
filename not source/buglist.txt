Webpage:
1. Currently, when the 3D twitch object is loaded, all the volumes are set to default.  Ideally, we want 3 of them set to mute and one set to around 25%
2. due to the natural of the API sometimes streamers will not change the language accordingly causing the language filter to fail
3. if either view filters are set below 50 ~ the load time becomes very long

4. The 3D twitch object will not have the correct dimensions sometimes depending on the browser/machine the user has. Known issues: Windows lab machines: chrome, and Fedora Lab machines: firefox.
5. this one time the links all stopped working and would not refresh but after closing and reopening the tab it went all
6. the CSS OF THE ARROWS  looks different on different browsers
7. ADD filter and hide filter can sometimes lag
8.  get list of online users order will not always be correct
9.  if a game is only in the top ten only cause one person  has ten-thousand viewers (Daynine) it will appear that the filters do not function as no streams will be found is much more likely    
Extension:

1. Upon button click, the "random stream" algorithm has poor performance time
2. Occasionally when opening the extension popup, the height of the panel is sometimes far larger than the CSS tells it to be


Test_Bench

1. test bench must be refreshed after all of the web pages have finished loading
